This is a story about our questüèîÔ∏è to try to uncover what internal reforms within police departments that can significantly reduce civilian complaints against law enforcement.

## Starting Pointüö∂

Investigating internal police department reforms is vital for fostering accountable and effective law enforcement. This urgency is underscored by the importance of building public trust, a fundamental aspect of community safety and cooperation. Accountability in policing is crucial; it not only misconduct but also reinforces the public's faith in the justice system. Better policing involves practices that prioritize de-escalation, fairness, and community engagement, ensuring that officers perform their duties with respect for all individuals.

The Murder of George Floyd highlighted the dire consequences of inadequate police accountability. Floyd's death, a result of police brutality, ignited nationwide protests and calls for systemic change. This tragedy brought to the forefront the need for substantial reform in policing, emphasizing the necessity of transparent, respectful, and human rights-oriented law enforcement practices. Ultimately, delving into internal police reforms is not merely a strategy to reduce complaints; it's a crucial step towards ensuring that law enforcement operates with integrity, fairness, and in alignment with democratic values and human dignity. 

## Where we Landedüõ¨

As we combed through loads of news articles and datasets, a question gradually took shape in our minds: Could it be that police departments which pivot towards the use of less lethal force receive fewer complaints from civilians?ü§î As police officers are better equipped with various level of forces to implement, naturally people will file less complain about police use of force. 

During this analytical process, we stumbled upon an unexpected pattern while examining the linear relationship between the implementation of less lethal force and the volume of civilian complaints. The graph, as illustrated below, unexpectedly displayed a weak positive correlation between these two variables. This was a conundrum that challenged our initial assumptions.

Intrigued by this revelation, we decided examine the ratio of less lethal force to the total use of force against civlilian complaints. To visualize this relationship, we opted to create a heatmap(1), a decision that brought us face-to-face with an even more baffling discovery. The heatmap revealed an absence of a significant correlation, manifested in a stark white space. This unexpected finding left us astounded. How could there be virtually no apparent relationship between these two critical aspects of police force usage? This result not only baffled us but also fueled our academic curiosity, prompting further investigation into this complex and uncharted territory.ü§Ø

<blockquote style="font-size: 0.8em;">
  "(1)a heatmap typically represents a matrix of data values using color gradients. Each cell in the heatmap corresponds to a data point and is colored based on its value relative to other values in the dataset. This allows for quick identification of patterns, correlations, and outliers within the data. For instance, in a dataset representing temperature variations, warmer colors could indicate higher temperatures and cooler colors lower ones. Heatmaps in R are particularly useful for exploring and presenting large datasets, making them a staple tool in data science for uncovering hidden structures and relationships in the data."

## PitstopüèéÔ∏è

As we delved deeper into analyzing the unexpected results, we reached a pivotal conclusion. It became clear that regardless of the reduced intensity in the use of force, the police are still employing a form of force, or violence, against community members. This realization led us to understand that, from the perspective of the public, the distinction between different types of force, such as being pepper-sprayed versus being struck with a baton, might not significantly alter their perception. In essence, the core issue lies in the very act of force being used, rather than its severity. This insight suggests that any form of force, whether lethal or less lethal, could be viewed similarly in terms of how it impacts civilian complaints and public trust.

## End Gameüöè

In light of our initial findings, we decided to re-examine our dataset to explore alternative hypotheses. Our attention then shifted to the demographics of police departments. Could a more diverse police force correlate with fewer civilian complaints? The rationale behind this is straightforward: a police force that mirrors the diversity of the community it serves might be more empathetic and understanding, thereby potentially reducing friction.

To assess this, we applied a diversity index to standardize the departments (details elaborated in the data page). Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) initially revealed a promising correlation. However, a twist emerged when we conducted regression analysis. Surprisingly, the predictors for diversity were positive, contradicting our original hypothesis of 'more diversity leading to fewer complaints.'

This led us to scrutinize our dataset more closely. Post-cleaning, from an alleged 16,000 departmental entries, only 800+ remained, casting doubts on its representativeness for the entire United States. Moreover, we observed that larger cities often contributed the most complete and detailed data. Consequently, we concluded that neither the diversity within the police force nor the shift to less lethal force significantly impacts civilian complaints against policing. However, the dataset's skewed representation towards major cities likely influenced our results.

Our research underscored a critical issue: the lack of a standardized national mechanism for reporting police activity hampers the ability to accurately gauge the impact of policing on local communities. Post-2020, it's challenging to ascertain if there's a nationwide improvement in police discipline. We also discovered that many police departments intentionally obstruct public record requests, a significant factor behind the creation of the police scoreboard website.

Looking ahead, we strongly advocate for a national standard in reporting police use of force and internal affairs complaints. Such a standard would greatly enhance transparency and accountability within police departments, contributing to the prevention of tragedies like the murder of George Floyd. It's through these systemic changes that we can hope to see a real transformation in policing, one that truly serves and protects all communities.
