## Source of our Dataüìä
[![](images/scoreboard.png)](https://policescorecard.org)
We found the data we need while doing research on police accountability while we came across this website on analyzing police conducts across the country. While browsing through the website, we found that they put all the source data they use in scoring police conducts into a [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XAT1uFPXj5AsvNTzFeNeeTXGLP09HEIh). The dataset we will be utilizing here will be the [Fact Checking dataset ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AJFk9ILwxg2oJEDP4xj0C9Qi9lZLJNnxKG5NNPO__GA/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Origins and Purpose of the Dataüö®:
The Police Scorecard, the primary data source, represents the first extensive nationwide analysis of police performance in the United States. Covering over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, it provides a detailed evaluation based on numerous factors such as levels of police violence, accountability, racial bias, and other critical aspects of policing. The criteria for this scorecard were meticulously chosen through a collaborative effort involving a review of existing research literature, consultations with experts and activists in the field, and an examination of available policing datasets from various governmental levels. The primary objective of the Police Scorecard is to facilitate informed actions aimed at minimizing police use of force, enhancing accountability, and redefining public safety across communities.

#### The Team Behind the Project üôå:
The mastermind behind the Police Scorecard is Samuel Sinyangwe, who collaborated with a diverse team comprising data scientists, designers, developers, organizers, and students nationwide. This team is united by their belief in leveraging data for promoting justice, accountability, and transformative change. Continuously evolving, the project's methodology is regularly updated to reflect new feedback and data availability from local, state, and federal agencies. It now includes broader indicators like police stops and searches, the extent of police militarization, analysis of policies and procedures, and outcomes related to disciplinary actions.





## Overview of our DataüëÄ

Our analysis leverages detailed information from three key datasets found in the [Fact Checking dataset ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AJFk9ILwxg2oJEDP4xj0C9Qi9lZLJNnxKG5NNPO__GA/edit?usp=sharing), each with its specific variables:

* Civilian Complaints Data: This dataset provides an in-depth look into the complaints filed by civilians against police officers. It is a crucial resource for understanding the nature and frequency of grievances raised by the public.
  * Police Department: Identifies the police department involved in the complaint.
  * ORI (Originating Agency Identifier): A unique identifier assigned to law enforcement agencies.
  * Civilian Complaints Reported: The total number of complaints filed by civilians.
  * Civilian Complaints Sustained: Number of civilian complaints that were substantiated after investigation.
  * Use of Force Complaints Reported: Complaints specifically related to the use of force by officers.
  * Use of Force Complaints Sustained: Use of force complaints that were upheld upon review.
  * Discrimination Complaints Reported: Complaints alleging discriminatory practices.
  * Discrimination Complaints Sustained: Number of discrimination complaints found to be valid.
  * Criminal Complaints Reported: Complaints related to alleged criminal conduct by officers.
  * Criminal Complaints Sustained: Criminal complaints that were confirmed after investigation.
  * Complaints in Detention Reported: Complaints originating from detention or custody settings.
  * Complaints in Detention Sustained: Number of detention-related complaints that were substantiated.

&nbsp;

* Use of Force Data: This sheet contains comprehensive information on instances where force was applied by police officers. It is instrumental in assessing the patterns and contexts in which force is used in law enforcement.
  * Police Department: Names the specific police department.
  * ORI (Originating Agency Identifier): Unique code for each law enforcement agency.
  * Population: The population size under the jurisdiction of the police department.
  * Total Use of Force Incidents: Aggregate number of force application incidents.
  * Total 'Less Lethal' Force: Incidents involving non-lethal force methods.

&nbsp;

* Officer Demography Data: This dataset offers demographic details of the police officers, such as age, race, gender, and years of service. It's essential for analyzing how different demographic factors might correlate with policing practices and behaviors.
  * ORI (Originating Agency Identifier): Unique identifier for law enforcement agencies.
  * Percent Officers White: Proportion of officers who are white.
  * Percent Officers Black: Proportion of officers who are black.
  * Percent Officers Hispanic: Proportion of officers who are Hispanic.
  * Percent Officers Asian/Pacific: Proportion of officers of Asian or Pacific Islander descent.
  * Percent Officers Native American: Proportion of officers who are Native American.
  * Percent Officers Other: Proportion of officers from other racial or ethnic backgrounds.

## Data Loading and Cleaning Processüßπ

* Missing Values in Various Variables: We encountered variables with NA (Not Available) values across our datasets. For instance, in datasets like cleansed_df1, use_for_force, cop_demo, and ori_lookup, we found variables with missing data. We decided to replace these NAs with zeros, particularly in variables where zeros were a meaningful representation, such as in count or frequency data.
```{r}
convert_na_to_zero <- function(data){
  result <- data %>% mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))
  return(result)
}
```

* Column Names Across Datasets: We standardized the names of variables across all datasets for consistency. This process was crucial for variables with different naming conventions across different CSV files, such as those in cleansed_df1 and use_for_force_original. We used janitor::clean_names() to ensure that all variable names followed a uniform format.

* Selecting Relevant Variables for Analysis: We selectively chose variables from each dataset relevant to our analysis. For example, in the civilian_complaints dataset, we focused on variables like police_department, state, ori, civilian_complaints_sustained_2020, and others, discarding those not pertinent to our study.

* Creating the Diversity Metric Variable(See more below): A significant part of our data transformation involved creating a new variable, the 'diversity metric', from existing data. We derived this metric from variables starting with 'percent_officers' in the merged_df dataset. This new variable allowed us to analyze aspects of our data focusing on diversity, which was not immediately apparent from the raw data.
```{r}
calculate_diversity_metrix <- function(proportions) {
  -sum(proportions * log(proportions, base = exp(1)), na.rm = TRUE) 
}
```

* Variables for Merging Datasets: To prepare for merging datasets, we ensured that key variables, such as 'ORI' in use_for_force and cleansed_df1, were compatible across datasets. This was a critical step for accurately combining information from different sources.
```{r}
merged_df<-merged_df|>
  mutate(
    diversity_metrix=apply(select(merged_df, starts_with("percent_officers")), 1, calculate_diversity_metrix),
    .after=7
  )
```

## Shannon Diversity Index Application in Our DatasetüóÇÔ∏è
![](images/diversity.png)

  * Categories as Races: In our dataset, each race is treated as a distinct category. The Shannon Diversity Index allows us to measure how these racial categories are represented and distributed within the dataset, particularly focusing on the police force.
  * Objective: Our main aim is to explore potential correlations or associations between racial diversity in the police force and the frequency or nature of civilian complaints. By applying this index, we can quantitatively evaluate these aspects.
Working Principle of the Shannon Diversity Index:
  * Abundance and Evenness: The index calculates diversity by taking into account not just the number of categories (in our case, racial groups) but also how evenly the individuals (police officers) are distributed among these categories.
  * Formula and Calculation: The index is computed using a specific formula that considers the proportion of each category and then incorporates these proportions into a logarithmic equation to calculate diversity.
  * Interpreting the Index: A higher value of the Shannon Diversity Index indicates greater diversity, reflecting not only a variety of categories but also a more uniform distribution among them. Conversely, a lower value suggests less diversity, potentially indicating overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain groups.


### Significance in Our Research:
  * Evaluating Inclusivity and Representation: The Shannon Diversity Index will be instrumental in assessing the level of inclusivity and representation of different racial groups in the police force. This is crucial for understanding the dynamics of diversity within law enforcement.
  * Testing Hypotheses: By analyzing the diversity index results, we can critically examine our hypothesis about the relationship between racial diversity in the police force and civilian complaints. It helps us to determine if a more diverse police force correlates with lower rates of complaints, suggesting better community relations and understanding.
  * Broader Implications: The findings derived from this index could provide valuable insights for policymakers and law enforcement agencies in addressing diversity-related issues and improving community-police relations.

By employing the Shannon Diversity Index in our analysis, we gain a nuanced and quantitative understanding of racial diversity within the police force, which is vital for testing our hypotheses and drawing meaningful conclusions about the impact of diversity on police-civilian interactions.
