This is a story about our questüèîÔ∏è to try to uncover what internal reforms within police departments that can significantly reduce civilian complaints against law enforcement.

## Starting Pointüö∂

Investigating internal police department reforms is vital for fostering accountable and effective law enforcement. This urgency is underscored by the importance of building public trust, a fundamental aspect of community safety and cooperation. Accountability in policing is crucial; it not only misconduct but also reinforces the public's faith in the justice system. Better policing involves practices that prioritize de-escalation, fairness, and community engagement, ensuring that officers perform their duties with respect for all individuals.

The Murder of George Floyd highlighted the dire consequences of inadequate police accountability. Floyd's death, a result of police brutality, ignited nationwide protests and calls for systemic change. This tragedy brought to the forefront the need for substantial reform in policing, emphasizing the necessity of transparent, respectful, and human rights-oriented law enforcement practices. Ultimately, delving into internal police reforms is not merely a strategy to reduce complaints; it's a crucial step towards ensuring that law enforcement operates with integrity, fairness, and in alignment with democratic values and human dignity. 

## Where we Landedüõ¨

As we combed through loads of news articles and datasets, a question gradually took shape in our minds: Could it be that police departments which pivot towards the use of less lethal force receive fewer complaints from civilians?ü§î

During this analytical process, we stumbled upon an unexpected pattern while examining the linear relationship between the implementation of less lethal force and the volume of civilian complaints. The graph, as illustrated below, unexpectedly displayed a weak positive correlation between these two variables. This was a conundrum that challenged our initial assumptions.

Intrigued by this revelation, we decided examine the ratio of less lethal force to the total use of force against civlilian complaints. To visualize this relationship, we opted to create a heatmap(1), a decision that brought us face-to-face with an even more baffling discovery. The heatmap revealed an absence of a significant correlation, manifested in a stark white space. This unexpected finding left us astounded. How could there be virtually no apparent relationship between these two critical aspects of police force usage? This result not only baffled us but also fueled our academic curiosity, prompting further investigation into this complex and uncharted territory.ü§Ø

(1)a heatmap typically represents a matrix of data values using color gradients. Each cell in the heatmap corresponds to a data point and is colored based on its value relative to other values in the dataset. This allows for quick identification of patterns, correlations, and outliers within the data. For instance, in a dataset representing temperature variations, warmer colors could indicate higher temperatures and cooler colors lower ones. Heatmaps in R are particularly useful for exploring and presenting large datasets, making them a staple tool in data science for uncovering hidden structures and relationships in the data.

* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* This page should be self-contained.
