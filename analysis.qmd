We describe here our detailed data analysis.
Introduce what motivates our Data Analysis (DA)
## Motivation and Introduction to Dataset
The Police Scorecard database consolidates information from various authoritative databases both on the federal and state levels, such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR), the Bureau of Justice Statistics' Annual Jail Survey, the US Census Bureau's Assessment of State and Local Government Finances, and the California Department of Justice's OpenJustice database. This project is designed to help communities, researchers, police leaders and policy-makers take data-informed action to reduce police use of force, increase accountability and reimagine public safety in their jurisdictions. In instances where specific agencies did not provide data to these recognized platforms, they looked towards local publications and news articles as alternative sources. 
Furthermore, details regarding fatalities resulting from police actions were sourced from the Mapping Police Violence database. This database records every instance where police actions directly led to an individual's demise, be it through firearms or other means. In addition to this, information about non-fatal instances of police using force and complaints about police misconduct was gathered directly from the respective police departments. This was done through accessing public records, scrutinizing annual reports, and navigating through the open data websites of these departments.
## Research Question
Our research question is that is there relationship between the diversity of police officers (races)  of each police department and civilian complains towards the police?
Our target variables are diversity index and civilian complaints.

## EDA and Modelling🧱

```{r}
filtered_cleansed_df1 <- cleansed_df1 %>%
  group_by(ORI) %>%
  filter(n() == 1)
print(filtered_cleansed_df1)

filtered_use_for_force <- use_for_force %>%

print(filtered_use_for_force)
```

```{r}
colnames(filtered_use_for_force)[colnames(filtered_use_for_force) == "Police Department"] <- "police_department"

merged_data <- merge(filtered_use_for_force,filtered_cleansed_df1, by = "ORI", all = TRUE)
merged_data <- subset(merged_data, select = -police_department.x)
```
## Heatmap📍
```{r}

selected_columns <- c("Total_Less_lethal_force_2020","Population","civilian_complaints_sustained_2020","discrimination_complaints_sustained_2020")
cor_matrix <- cor(merged_data[selected_columns], use = "complete.obs")
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "full", order = "hclust", 
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, 
         diag = TRUE) 
```
In the context of analyzing data related to police brutality, particularly focusing on aspects of police use of force and complaints, we calculated a correlation matrix and visualized it as a heatmap for these variables: total_less_lethal_force_2020, population, civilian_complaints_sustained_2020, and discrimination_complaints_sustained_2020. We found that there is a strong correlation between population variable and total less lethal force in 2020, so we used these specific variables to further investigate our research question and create a simple linear regression plot that assesses the distribution of total less lethal force by population.

```
##Analysis of Linear Regression model:
This linear regression model is used to analyze and visualize the relationship between the rate of less-lethal force usage by population and the rate of sustained civilian complaints in different police departments.  Since the graph displays a fairly weak positive correlation between rate of less-lethal force usage and rate of sustained civilian complaints. As the use of force (per population) by the police increases, the number of sustained civilian complaints (per population) also tends to increase. In areas or periods where police use more less-lethal force, there tend to be more complaints sustained against the police. The observed trend indicates that in areas or periods with heightened less-lethal force usage, there is a corresponding increase in complaints sustained against the police. This pattern warrants attention as it could reflect public perception or reaction to the police's use of force. The correlation might be indicative of broader issues related to how less-lethal force is applied and perceived by the community. Higher rates of complaints could stem from a perceived overuse or inappropriate use of force, even if it's classified as less-lethal.

##Analysis of stacked bar chart:
To further visualize the discrepancy in civilian complaints among major cities in the United States, we plotted a stacked bar chart that depicts 3 major cities with civilian complaints reported per capita in 2017 vs. 2021. The purpose is to visualize any changes in civilian complaints in these cities before and after the George Floyd incident, a key event in America’s history of police brutality incidents that may have greatly contributed to the amount of complaints different police departments representing different cities in the country receive. The decrease in complaints per capita from 2017 to 2021 might indicate changes or improvements in policing practices, as the global attention brought by George Floyd's death in 2020 could have prompted police departments to implement reforms, more stringent use-of-force policies, or enhanced training, leading to a reduction in actions that result in civilian complaints.

## Analysis of Linear Regression Model and Residuals:
First, we fitted a linear regression model using the lm() function. The model predicts civilian_complaints_sustained_2020 (dependent variable) based on Total_Less_lethal_force_2020 (independent variable). This model helps us explore the relationship between the use of less lethal force and the frequency of sustained civilian complaints. After calculating the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values), we plotted them against the fitted values. This plot is crucial for identifying non-random patterns (like trends or clusters), which can signal potential issues in the model such as non-linearity or heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance). The Quantile-Quantile plot was generated to assess the normality of the residuals. Deviations from a straight line in this plot would indicate departures from normality. In our case, the plot showed a generally normal distribution, as indicated by a symmetric, bell-shaped curve centered around zero. This plot provides another perspective on the distribution of the residuals. Similar to the Q-Q plot, the density plot in our analysis suggested that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.The primary purpose of these steps is to assess the fit and assumptions of the linear regression model. The mean of the residuals being 0 is a good sign, indicating no bias in the model's predictinos. However, the wide range between the minimum (-126.032) and maximum (561.850) values of the residuals indicates that certain predictions by the model are significantly off-target.The negative values for the first three quartiles indicate a tendency towards overestimation in the model's predictions.The substantial difference between the minimum and maximum residuals suggests the presence of outliers or extreme values, which might not be well-represented by the model.

#Interpretation of Diversity Plot:
The linear upward trend in the plot suggests that as you move through different categories or levels (represented by positions), there is a consistent and uniform increase in diversity (represented by diversity_values) across the police departments. This implies that the diversity in these departments increases in a predictable and steady manner from one position to the next.

We graphed a bar chart to aggregate civilian complaints reported from 2016 to 2022 for each police department. These totals are then polotted against the Shannon Diversity Index, calculated based on the racial and ethnic composition of their officers. This index serves as a quantitative measure of diversity, with higher values indicating greater diversity. We grouped the data into ten categories representing different ranges of diversity. It appears that the police departments in higher bracket diversity ranges receive higher complaints, and lower diversity ranges receive fewer complaints in general, which appears countertuitive to our hypothesis.

The second bar chart delves into complaints per capita, providing a nuanced view by accounting for the population size served by each police department. This helps us assess whether a higher diversity within police departments correlates with variations in the rate of complaints. Our bar chart visualizations reveal a positive correlation between police force diversity and civilian complaints, a finding that initially seems counterintuitive to our hypothesis. This insight propels us to investigate further: we are now exploring other regression models to  better understand the relationship between our target variables. As we uncover new insights, we are continuously refining our visualizations and statistical models. This iterative process ensures that our visual representations and analyses accurately reflect the complexities of the data. Due to these patterns from the bar charts and a non-linear relatinship that may not be captured by our linear regression model, we will thus employ more sophisticated statistical techniques, such as using a poisson regression model to assess if there any significant relationship between our target variables. We believe poisson regression approach is well-suited for count data like civilian complaints.🧮

## Interpretation of Poisson regression model: 
The coefficient of the diversity_metrix suggests that an increase in the diversity metric significantly increases the log count of civilian complaints. This might indicate that departments with greater diversity see more reported complaints, but it's important to consider potential confounding factors. The positive coefficient for population implies that larger populations are associated with a higher log count of civilian complaints. This is intuitive, as larger populations would naturally have more interactions with the police. The coefficient of "Total Less Lethal Force 2020" indicates that an increase in less lethal force usage is associated with a higher log count of civilian complaints. It suggests a relationship between the frequency of using less lethal force and the number of complaints. The model shows a statistically significant relationship between the predictors and total number of civilian complaints. Increased diversity might correlate with higher reported complaints due to various reasons. For instance, more diverse departments could be located in areas with higher population densities or more active community engagement, leading to a higher number of interactions and, consequently, complaints.Diverse departments might have more robust or transparent reporting mechanisms, encouraging community members to report complaints more freely. There also may be confounding factors influencing this relationship. For example, socio-economic factors, community-police relations, or regional differences in policing practices could play a significant role influencing the relationship between total civilian complaints and diversity among the police departments.

## Interpretation of heatmap:
We created the heatmap that is represented as a correlation matrix to evaluate the relationship between the diversity in police departments and the total civilian complaints reported in 2020.There seems to be a fairly positive correlation between diversity in police departments and number of civilian complaints reported in 2020. Diverse police departments may be more visible or scrutinized in their communities, leading to a higher likelihood of civilian complaints being reported. This could be due to increased community engagement or a higher level of trust that complaints will be taken seriously. In addition, departments with more diversity might be situated in urban or diverse areas where a larger number of interactions between police and civilians naturally leads to more complaints. The correlation could reflect underlying socio-demographic dynamics rather than the direct impact of the police force's diversity, which could be a confounding factor.



## Limtations⛔️
Through various data visualizations, including heatmaps and diversity bar charts, we have identified a positive correlation between the diversity of police forces and the rate of civilian complaints. This finding is somewhat unexpected, diverging from our initial hypothesis which posited that increased diversity in police departments might correlate with fewer complaints. The counterintuitive nature of this correlation prompts us to delve deeper into the data. We are currently exploring potential confounding variables that could be influencing this relationship. These could include factors like socio-economic status of the areas served by the departments, variations in community policing practices, or regional differences in reporting mechanisms for complaints. Our residual analysis, particularly using the Pearson residual plot, did not reveal a clear pattern, suggesting an acceptable fit of the model in terms of linearity and homogeneity of variance. However, the deviance residual plot indicates the possibility of overdispersion - in which the variance in the response variable is larger than predicted by the model. Overdispersion can affect the reliability of standard error estimates and test statistics, leading to potentially misleading inferences. To address the issue of overdispersion, we plan to employ a negative binomial regression model. This model is more flexible for count data with overdispersion and can provide more accurate estimates of the regression coefficients and their standard errors. The negative binomial regression will allow us to re-assess the relationship between police force diversity and civilian complaints, potentially offering a more nuanced understanding of this dynamic.
